abstract: Gas phase complexes formed between bromide and iodide anions and molecular oxygen are investigated via high level CCSD(T) calculations and experimental anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Experimental electron binding energies of the *<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub>* and *<sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub>* states are determined to be 3.43 and 3.90 eV, and 3.12 and 4.06 eV for the bromide and iodide complexes respectively. Calculations predict one minimum for each of the halide-oxygen complexes corresponding to a bent *C<sub>s</sub> geometry, while for the analogous neutral (radical) complexes two stationary points were located; one linear (*C<sub>$\infty$v</sub>*) and another T-shaped (*C<sub>2v</sub>*). These lie close in energy to one another ($\Delta$E < 1 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) suggesting that internal rotation of the oxygen molecule is highly likely.
