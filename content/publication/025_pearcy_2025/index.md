abstract: The structures of gas-phase platinum nitrosyl ion–molecule complexes, [Pt(NO)<sub>n</sub>]<sup>+</sup> (n = 3–7), have been investigated using a combination of infrared photodissociation action spectroscopy and quantum chemical simulations. Nitric oxide binds in a combination of linear and bent motifs associated with nominal three- and one-electron donation, respectively, and there is clear evidence of a first solvation shell closing at six ligands. Oxygen rich complexes are also observed in the mass spectrum and their infrared spectra indicate the formation of an N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> moiety. Calculations support the interpretation of [Pt(N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)(NO)<sub>n</sub>]<sup>+</sup> complexes arising from exothermic intracluster reactions in which [<span>&#183;&#183;&#183;</span>(NO)<sub>3</sub><span>&#183;&#183;&#183;</span>]<sup>+</sup> complexes form [<span>&#183;&#183;&#183;</span>(NO<sub>2</sub>)(N<sub>2</sub>O)<span>&#183;&#183;&#183;</span>]<sup>+</sup> species from which the more weakly-bound nitrous oxide is lost.
