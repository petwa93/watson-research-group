abstract: Phosphine is attracting interest due to the role it plays in extraterrestrial and interplanetary atmospheric environments. Phosphorus hydride anion and neutral van der Waals complexes with CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, HCCH, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S and NH<sub>3</sub> have been investigated as potential targets for photoelectron spectroscopy using a combination of DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ optimised geometries, W2w energies and Franck–Condon simulations. All anion complexes exhibit hydrogen-bonding interactions and while complexes with CH<sub>4</sub> are weakly bound, showing minimal perturbation upon complexation. All other solvating molecules studied yield sufficient energetic or vibrational structural differences to be differentiable in photoelectron spectra. Most notably, PH<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CO<sub>2</sub> undergoes barrierless nucleophilic addition to form the phosphino formate anion (PH<sub>2</sub>COO<sup>−</sup>) and is proposed as one such potential atmospheric sink.
