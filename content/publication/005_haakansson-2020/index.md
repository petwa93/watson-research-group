abstract: The gas phase anion photoelectron spectrum associated with the bromide-bromomethyl radical is presented. The stabilisation energy and electron binding energy, a property corresponding to the electron affinity of the neutral complex, are determined. Ab initio MP2 optimisations (with additional CCSD(T) energies) found two forms of the complex, a hydrogen bonded complex and a halogen bonded complex. The halogen bonded complex was found to exhibit *C<sub>2v</sub>* symmetry and the hydrogen bonded complex exhibited *C<sub>s</sub>* symmetry. Comparison between the experimental data and the computational data allow conclusions to be drawn about the structure of the experimentally observed species.
