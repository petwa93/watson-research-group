abstract: A combined experimental and theoretical approach has been used to investigate X<sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O (X=F, Cl, Br, I) complexes in the gas phase. Photoelectron spectroscopy, in tandem with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, has been used to determine electron binding energies for the Cl<sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O, Br<sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O, and I<sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O species. Additionally, high-level CCSD(T) calculations found a *C<sub>2v</sub>* minimum for these three anion complexes, with predicted electron detachment energies in excellent agreement with the experimental photoelectron spectra. F<sup>−</sup>$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O was also studied theoretically, with a *C<sub>s</sub>* hydrogen-bonded complex found to be the global minimum. Calculations extended to neutral X$\cdots$CH<sub>2</sub>O complexes, with the results of potential interest to atmospheric CH<sub>2</sub>O chemistry.
