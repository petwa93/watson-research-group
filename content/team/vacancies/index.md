        ### Available RTP Opportunities in [Liquid Microjet Spectroscopy](https://watsonlaserlab.com/research/liquid_jets/)
        
        #### Project Overview

        This project uses laser spectroscopy to study molecules as they evaporate from liquid surfaces. It involves the construction and testing of apparatus followed by experimentation using model systems as spectroscopic probes.

        **Aims**

        The aim of this project is to understand how the properties of molecules, namely their temperature, changes at liquid-air interfaces. This will be done by utilising molecules with well characterised photoionisation spectra and investigating how these spectra change depending on the nature of the liquid interface.

        **Objectives**

        The objectives of this project will be to construct and recommission a liquid microjet apparatus and undertake initial testing and characterisation of the instrument. This will entail the physical construction of the apparatus, testing of components and laser systems, and design and implementation of data acquisition software. Following this, initial experimental studies using simple spectroscopic probe molecules will investigate the nature of the liquid-air interface under varying solute-solvent conditions.

        In addition to this project, a student will have the opportunity to engage in all aspects of work within the Watson Research Group and contribute to projects utilising central laser facilities and light sources, and make use of high-performance computational resources.

        **Significance**

        The significance of this work is to understand how the reactivity of molecules emitted into the atmosphere changes at liquid-air interfaces such as those in aerosols. While atmospheric models are becoming increasingly sophisticated, reactions at interfaces are limited. How does reactivity change under solvated conditions and does the composition of solvent systems further effect this?

        **Ideal Candidate**

        This project would suit a self-motivated PhD candidate with a background in either chemistry, physics or chemical engineering (must be eligible to enrol in PhD programs at Curtin). This project is designed to be approachable with a focus on research training and prospective candidates should be inquisitive and demonstrate an eagerness to learn and develop new skills. Experience in spectroscopy or the use of lasers is ideal. Desirable skills also include the ability to project manage and maintain requisite safety documentation, familiarity with common electronic structure packages, programming with a focus on instrument control and data acquisition, and basic electronics.

        This project is open to domestic and international applicants.

        **Scholarships at Curtin**
