<!--More-->

We have boots on the ground at Curtin today. After a period of remote working and wrapping up some projects with the Mackenzie Group and the University of Oxford, Peter is moving into space in Building 204 of the Bentley Campus here at Curtin.

This year is due to be a big one with the group being already awarded beamtime at the [FELIX free-electron laser](https://www.ru.nl/en/hfml-felix) based in Nijmegen in the Netherlands coming up this year (if you're an interested student do [Contact Us!](https://watsonlaserlab.com/contact/)). Meanwhile, we'll be working to get the lab space in Building 500 set up for recommissioning of both the laser systems and the [liquid microjet experiment](https://watsonlaserlab.com/research/liquid_jets) and looking to fund some new projects and collaborations.
