The Watson Group ventured to ECU to work with Duncan Wild on the TOF-PES instrument!

Today marked the first day of experimental work in the Watson group but with a twist. New students [Hannah Finlay](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/hannah-finlay/), [Neve Annett](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/neve-annett/) and [Cosima Biagioni](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/cosima-biagioni/) joined Peter and [Duncan Wild at ECU](https://watsonlaserlab.com/post/24-12-06-ecu-spec-launch/) to start work on the time-of-flight photoelectron spectrometer (TOF-PES).

The group was working towards Hannah's project, making ion-molecule complexes of fluoride and cyanide anions. The gorup was also receiving some key training on working with gas-phase spectrometers for Cosi and Neve ahead of research trips to HFML-FELIX in May.

It was also just great to get back into the lab, working with instruments, and tinkering again!
