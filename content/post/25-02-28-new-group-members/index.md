Welcome to the first cohort of students in the Watson Laser Lab!

<!--More-->

It's a fantastic day as we welcome the first cohort of students to the Watson Laser Lab. Our first cohort are studying Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degrees here at Curtin and will be contributing to a number of projects within the group!

[Noah Corbett](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/noah-corbett/) joins the group to help establish the [Laser Synthesis in Solution (LASiS)](https://watsonlaserlab.com/research/lasis/) platform and perform some initial testing and production runs of metal nanoparticles.

[Hannah Finlay](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/hannah-finlay/) will be working alongside Peter and collaborator Duncan Wild to test new precusors in Duncan's time-of-flight photoelectron spectrometer. Her goal will be to make fluoride (F<sup>-</sup>) and cyanide (CN<sup>-</sup>) anions and broaden the scope of systems that Duncan can study and complement this experimental work with ab initio calculations.

[Neve Annett](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/neve-annett/) and [Cosima Biagioni](https://watsonlaserlab.com/author/cosima-biagioni/) will be investigating metal clusters as potential [unidentified infrared emission (UIE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_infrared_emission) band carriers. Both will travel to HFML-FELIX to use unique combination of free-electron laser, laser vaporisation source and molecular beam apparatus to generate these systems and study their infrared spectra.
