The Watson Laser Lab have been awarded $20,000 to kickstart work in the group!

<!--More-->

The group is excited to announce some award success as a recipient of a [Early Career Researcher Grant](https://watsonlaserlab.com/post/25-05-06-emcr-trailblazer/) from the [Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Trailblazer](https://rtcm-trailblazer.au/) with a value of $20,000! The grant process required submission of an EOI followed by pitching to potential industry partners.

This was a new test for Peter, who is more accustomed to presenting in an academic environment, but was an excellent opportunity to focus in on the benefits and value proposition of the work within the group. The funds will allow us to accellerate the [construction of our LASiS platform](https://watsonlaserlab.com/research/lasis/) and work alongside collaborators in the Shao Group for the ablation of new materials for catalysis!
