Published as part of the Mike Duncan Festschrift special issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry A, [this paper](https://watsonlaserlab.com/publication/023_rubli_2025/) represent the first output to come from Mackenzie Group collaborations with the Bakker Group at HFML-FELUX. The work here was part of the first beamtime run lead by Peter with colleagues from the University of Oxford and is an infrared multiple-photon photodissociation (IRMPD) study of cationic cobalt clusters (Co<sub>n</sub><sup>+</sup>) with bound NO molecules and argon tags.

In this study, we observe dissociation of the NO molecule upon interaction with the Co cluster, and insertion of the nitrogen and oxygen atoms into the cluster structure at bridged and/or three atom sites. We also note the role of the Ar tag, which in this case is not innocent when interacting with the cluster, exerting a notable perturbation of the IR spectrum.

A great piece of work to put the manuscript together by DPhil student Peter Rubli who has quickly become the expert on all things FELICE!
