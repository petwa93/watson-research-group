The Watson Laser Lab is a glad to celectrate successful experimental at the FELIX free-electron laser facility in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

Joining the group of Prof. Stuart Mackenzie from the University of Oxford where he had previously worked as a postdoc, Peter flew to the Netherlands two weeks of beamtime at the FELIX free-electron laser. Using the Free-Electron Laser for IntraCavity Experiments (FELICE) endstation, the team worked alongside the group of Joost Bakker and the FELIX operators to generate and study CO<sub>2</sub> activation on metal clusters.

This work will form part of Mackenzie Group students David Vesty's and Peter Rubli's (both pictured) Part II and PhD theses respectively and (fingers crossed), a few manuscripts down the line!
