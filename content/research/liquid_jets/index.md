## Overview

Spectroscopy of liquid microjets is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and molecular structure of liquids in vacuum. By producing a continuous stream of liquid through a micro-nozzle, this method enables high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of volatile and nonvolatile liquids.

## Objectives

- Investigate solvation dynamics at the molecular level.
- Study surface and bulk electronic structure.
- Explore time-resolved spectroscopy techniques.

## Methods

We employ ultraviolet and soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in a custom-designed vacuum system. The setup includes:

- High-precision micro-nozzles.
- Differential pumping stages.
- Time-of-flight and hemispherical analyzers.

## Collaborations

This project is conducted in collaboration with:

- The Institute of Molecular Science
- National Synchrotron Light Source
- University of Spectroscopic Research

## Publications

- Smith et al., *J. Chem. Phys.*, 2023.
- Doe et al., *Phys. Chem. Lett.*, 2024.
