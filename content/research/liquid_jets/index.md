## Overview

Spectroscopy of liquid microjets is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and molecular structure of liquids in vacuum.

## Objectives

- Investigate solvation dynamics
- Study surface and bulk electronic structure
- Explore time-resolved techniques

## Methods

We use ultraviolet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with:

- High-precision micro-nozzles
- Differential pumping
- Time-of-flight analyzers

## Collaborators

- Institute of Molecular Science  
- National Synchrotron Light Source  
- University of Spectroscopic Research
