Our research group focuses on developing novel spectroscopic methods and instrumentation for challenging chemical problems. We work across several key areas:

## Research Areas

- **Liquid Jets Systems**: Development of advanced liquid jet delivery systems for spectroscopic studies
- **High-Resolution Spectroscopy**: Pushing the boundaries of spectroscopic resolution and sensitivity  
- **Metal Clusters and Complexes**: Understanding the fundamental properties of metal systems through infrared spectroscopy
