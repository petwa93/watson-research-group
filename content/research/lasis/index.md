## Overview

Laser Ablation Synthesis in Solution (LASiS) is a physiochemical synthetic technique for the production of nanoparticles.

## Objectives

- Investigate solvation dynamics  
- Study surface and bulk electronic structure  
- Explore time-resolved techniques

## Methods

LASiS is highly tunable:

- High-precision micro-nozzles  
- Differential pumping  
- Time-of-flight analyzers

## Collaborators

- Institute of Molecular Science  
- National Synchrotron Light Source  
- University of Spectroscopic Research
