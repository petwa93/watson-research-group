Noah Corbett is a undergraduate chemical engineering & chemistry student at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.

He is due to complete his undergraduate double degree at the end of 2025. Under the supervision of Dr. Peter Watson, Noah is currently completing an honours research project studying the applicability and scalability of laser ablation synthesis in solution  for the production of nanoparticle water electrolyser catalysts. In addition to his studies, Noah has worked part-time in the alumina refining industry for two years in both chemical engineering and laboratory chemistry roles.
