Max Davidson is a Reseach Associate with a particular focus on traffic modelling, at the University of Western Australia in Perth, Australia.

He completed his PhD at the University of Western Australia under the supervision of Dr. Dylan Jayatilaka studying Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for high-resolution X-ray crystallography. Following completion of his PhD he took up a Research Associate position at the Planning and Transport Research Centre under the supervision of Dr Chao Sun, looking at modelling roundabouts in the greater Perth Area. Max has a passion for looking at the interplay between modelling (theory) and data (experiments) across a wide range of topics from cars to carcinogens, and looks to further this understanding through his collaborations with the group.

Max is working alongside the group in deployment of a genetic algorithm for efficient structure searches and providing advice and expertise on high-performance computing.
