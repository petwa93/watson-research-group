Duncan Wild is a Senior Lecturer in Physical Chemistry at Edith Cowan Univeristy in Perth, Australia.

He completed his PhD at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Prof Evan Bieske studying infrared spectroscopy of anion van der Waals complexes. Following completion of his PhD he took up a postdoctoral position with Dr. Thomas Lenzer at the Max-Planck-Institute for biophysical chemistry in Goettingen, Germany, focussing on time resolved energy relaxation dynamics of carotenoids, and apparatus construction. Duncan was at the University of Western Australia, from 2007-2022, where he constructed an anion photoelectron spectrometer. He joined Edith Cowan University, and has reconstructed the spectrometer there.

As part of the physical chemistry and gas-phase spectroscopy community in Perth, Western Australia, the Watson and [Wild research groups](https://laser.scb.uwa.edu.au/) work alongside each other to explore common interests in atmospheric chemistry, instrument design and computational chemistry.
