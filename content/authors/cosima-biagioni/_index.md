Cosima Biagioni is a 4th year chemical engineering student completing her honours at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. 

She will be performing research on spectroscopically relevant, ligand bound, [metal clusters via infrared photodissociation spectroscopy](https://watsonlaserlab.com/research/metal_clusters/), where she will be working alongside Peter as part of the Watson Group and visiting collaborators at [HFML-FELIX](https://hfml-felix.com/). In her free time, she experiments in the kitchen with bread and various ferments and has recently been given the title of 'Group foccacia maker' by her friends and family.
